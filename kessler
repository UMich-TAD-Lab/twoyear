# Children's Depression Inventory

## Twenge & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2002

* Meta-analysis on 310 samples/studies, aged 8-16, N = 61,424, 51.7% female, from U.S. or Canada
* Data used was collected between 1980 and 1998
* Each study may have had multiple waves
* No SES differences, no score differences in white vs. black samples
* Hispanic samples scored significantly higher on the CDI
* There was an interaction between age and gender
    * Girls' CDI scores were steady 8-12, then increased
    * Girls' CDI scores peaked at 15 and remained high at 16
    * Boys' CDI were steady 8-16 except were a bit higher at age 12

## Zhu, 2018

* Used a sample from 1995-1996, N = 4228, grades 7th to 12th, 52.3% female, all from the United States
* **Did not use the CDI**
* Measured depression using the "Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D"
* Adolescents participated in two waves with one year in between
* An adolescent is more likely to be depressed one year later if they are:
    * Female
    * African-American
    * Have low perceived family support and low school connectedness

## McLaughlin, Hilt, & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2007

* Recruited sample from two middle schools in central Connecitcut (I think around 2001ish, it's unclear)
* N = 1065, grades 6th to 8th, 51.2% male, 57% Hispanic/Latino
* Hispanic females had the highest CDI scores
* Hispanic adolescents (esp. females) and Black males had higher anxiety levels than other groups

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
gender <- c("male", "male", "male", "male", "female", "female", "female", "female")
race <- c("white", "black", "hispanic", "other", "white", "black", "hispanic", "other")

df <- data.frame(gender, race, cdi)
rm(gender)
rm(race)
rm(cdi)
df$cdi[df$gender == "male" & df$race == "white"] <- 8.33
df$cdi[df$gender == "female" & df$race == "white"] <- 8.13
df$cdi[df$gender == "male" & df$race == "black"] <- 9.55

## Bjorkenstam, Pebley, Burstrom, & Kosidou, 2017

* Obtained data from the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a nationally representative sample from three waves: 1997, 2002, and 2007, oversampled for African-American and low-income families
* N = 2223, born between 1985 and 1995, 50% female, 65% white, 17% African-American, 13% Hispanic
* Individuals exposed to childhood social adversity had higher CDI scores
* Didn't look at CDI scores in relation to gender or race
* Reported an overall mean CDI of 2.8, but I don't think that's right???

## Chaplin, Gillham, & Seligman, 2009

* Sample recruited from schools in northeastern US in 2002
* N = 113, aged 11-14, 79% white, took measures at two times (one year apart)
* Mean CDI score of 11.05
* Girls had higher CDI scores than boys but it wasn't significant
