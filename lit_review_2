    * N = 61,424 
    * aged 8-16
    * 51.7% female
    * All from U.S. or Canada
* Data used was collected between 1980 and 1998
* Each study may have had multiple waves
* No SES differences, no score differences in White vs. Black samples
* Hispanic samples scored significantly higher on the CDI
* There was an interaction between age and gender
    * Girls' CDI scores were steady 8-12, then increased
    * Girls' CDI scores peaked at 15 and remained high at 16
    * Boys' CDI were steady 8-16 except were a bit higher at age 12
